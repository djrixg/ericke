<b>Covalent bonds</b> 

<p>Covalent, ionic, and metallic intramolecular forces are the three forms of intramolecular forces bonding. Between two nonmetals, covalent bonds form. The atoms share electrons in this form of relationship.</p>

<p><b>Polar</b> and <b>Nonpolar</b> covalent bonds are the two types of covalent bonding. Covalent polar bonds are formed when two atoms with different electronegativity come together. Because of the difference in electronegativity, electrons are shared unequally, causing the more electronegative atom to have a partial negative charge and the more electropositive atom to have a partial positive charge. The intramolecular attraction in this picture is a polar bond.</p>

<p>Nonpolar covalent bonds are formed when two atoms have the same charge electronegativity, which is usually between two of the same atoms or between a pair of atoms. A carbon atom with a hydrogen atom. There are no partial charges since electrons are shared evenly occur. An example of a nonpolar bond is shown below.</p>
